##Personal MCS

###Motivation:

This is inspired by the [Personal MBA](http://personalmba.com/best-business-books/) by Josh Kaufman.  He compiled a list of books under disciplines that, if read, should constitute approximate knowledge of an MBA course.  This ignores the other benefits of an MBA like networking, but I resonate with the idea that the core knowledge can still be learned outside of a university.

I do not have a CS degree, and feel guilty when deeper topics of computer science come up and I have to google it to keep up.  A deeper understanding of topics covered in a classic computer science degree will probably provide a problem solving base I currently don't have.  I dislike school for many things, and figure that I can get a relative, if not more beneficial education from a structured curriculum around similar topics.

The Personal Masters of Computer Science (PMCS) will be on this repo, in a WIP state, for a long time.  Github is a good place for it to live in order for it to be accessible, easily changeable, and collaborative.

This will not just be a list of books.  The internet has given content creators the ability to teach through blog posts, videos, and code.  Here are a few other things I want to build this curriculum around:

1. To provide the *fewest* resources for each section that are useful.  There are countless books, blog posts, and videos online, and information overload saps enthusiasm.  Some sections inevitably will have lots of resources, but I hope to end up on the side of concise and achievable, and eventually, to have the next learner trust that what they are using for their curriculum has been vetted.  It would be reasonable to have an “Extra Resources” section per discipline.  These will likely change based on my perceptions, and your feedback.
 
2. I have quite a bit of professional experience, which I hope to inject into the curriculum along with the theory-heavy tendencies of classical education.  Hopefully, along with others, it will make this curriculum more practical for professionals than academics.

3. There are no tests or grades or deadlines.  This is not school.  But, there will be challenges, and suggestions for how to demonstrate competency in a field.  A example of this could be to write the same system in number of different language paradigms for the Programming Languages section.  For the Databases section, the challenge could be to build your own database.  For the Distributed Systems section, you could deploy a multiple node system and run a series of benchmarking and alerting scenarios.  The idea is to demonstrate expertise in a way that you find engaging.

Hopefully, we can get a list in this repo per discipline of a learner’s challenges for a little public appreciation and motivation.

I muddled together the first version of this curriculum from [Carnegie Mellon’s MCS curriculum](http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/master/curriculum.html) and [NYU’s MCS curriculum](http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/computer-science-ms/curriculum), as well as advice from others.  Expect these to change:


[Algorithm/Software Design and Testing]()

[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning]()

[Compilers]()

[Computer Architecture and Networks]()

[Cryptography and Security]()

[Databases]()

[Distributed Systems and Infrastructure]()

[Embedded Systems]()

[Operating Systems]()

[Programming Langauges]()

[Teams and Workplace]()

[Web and Mobile Applications]()
